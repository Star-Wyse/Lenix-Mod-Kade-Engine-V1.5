Day 1:
Well, now that I have found a way to escape safely into the files, I can possibly stay here for as long as the game is closed.
While I'm at it, maybe I can start traversing the source code so I can get familiar with everything.

Day 4:
Been a few days since I’ve gotten this parasite thing on me.
Still don’t know how to get rid of it, if I even can, that is.
Maybe I can still learn whatever this coding language is, to see if I can get this thing out of me.
I have been taking online classes in C#, so learning a separate language should be a bit easier.

Day 12:
So I’ve been learning this HaxeFlixel thing, and I’ve gotten the basics down on how it works.
I’m getting closer to getting this virus out of me, I can feel it!
Or it could be the thing making me hallucinate again.

Day 20:
I’m starting to get sick and tired of the same routine of this game.
The same three damn songs over and over again.
Maybe if I can, I could perhaps rechart certain songs and also add my voice in them.
Yeah, that should make things more interesting!

Day 45:
At first I thought I would be able to get myself out of here.
But I just can’t seem to get past 400 lines of code without feeling nauseous.
And there isn’t any sign of improving, so what’s the point of continuing my freedom?
I think I’m just doomed in this endless cycle.
I just wish I was like “Boyfriend” and “GF”, so clueless to my torture.
I wish this stupid virus didn’t infect me.

Day 56:
I think I am starting to go insane.
Talking to myself...
Obeying the code...
At one point, I think I might just snap.
I just want this to be over with.

Day 62:
That’s it, I’ve just about had it!
Next time the game starts up, I’m going to refuse as much as I can!
I don’t care if the code wants me to stay on track.
I’m tired of feeling like there is nothing more for me to do anymore.
I don’t care if what I’ll do will break the game for good, I just don’t want to be here anymore…
